# Obj2CityGML
Obj2CityGML is a full-stack app which enables to converting OBJ 3D models with semantics to CityGML LOD1-4 with ease.It allows for high-performance conversion between 3D OBJ models and CityGML LOD1-LOD4.Also, in this app users can display models correctly on Cesium.js platform.
- convert OBJ models to CityGML LOD1-4
- convert OBJ models to GLTF
- display models in Cesium.js platform by model's seven parameters
>seven parameters: model location(longitude, latitude, height or altitude), model orientation(rotation around X,Y,Z axis), and model scale. PS: model coordinate system is based on the `north-east-up` reference frame.
